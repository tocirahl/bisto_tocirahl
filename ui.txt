"Bistro" firmware
=================

This is designed for an ATTiny25V-based driver with off-time capacitor 
and FET+7135 power channel configuration.

The interface is as follows:
  (see bistro-ui.png for a quick start)

  While off:

    - Fully click and release to turn the light on.  It will go to the 
      first mode or the last-used mode, depending on whether you enabled 
      mode memory.

  While on:

    - Short tap: Do a short (less than 0.5s) half-press to go forward to 
      the next mode.

    - Med tap: Do a medium (0.5s to 1.5s) half-press to go backward to 
      the previous mode, if medium-press is enabled.

    - Long tap: Do a long (longer than 1.5s) half-press to reset to the 
      first mode (if mode memory is turned off).

    - Or fully click and release to turn the light off.

    - Short tap a bunch of times (15+ taps, or until the light stops 
      turning on) to enter config mode.

  Hidden modes:

    - Go backward from moon to access the hidden modes.  They are, in 
      order:

      - Turbo (just like the regular turbo)

      - Tactical / police strobe (7 Hz / 14 Hz alternating)

      - Battery check / beacon mode
        It should blink out the voltage in whole numbers then a '.' then 
        tenths.  So, for 3.6V it would blink out "--- . ------".  
        Voltage range is from about 2.5V to 4.4V

      - Biking flasher (2-level stutter beacon, 1 Hz)

  Configuration options:

    The config mode has several options.  It will blink out a number to 
    show which option is active, then "buzz" or "stutter" for a bit.  
    Click during the "buzz" to select that option.  Some options may 
    enter a secondary config mode after the light turns back on.

    Options include:

      1. Muggle mode / simple mode.  Good while lending the light to 
         others.  It overrides other config settings temporarily:
         - low/med/high, in that order, with high at about one third power.
         - no moon, no memory, no medium-presses, no hidden modes
         - the only config option is the option to exit muggle mode

      2. Mode memory.  Off or on.

      3. Moon.  Select to turn moon mode on or off.  This is in addition 
         to the other regular modes, so you get 2 to 9 levels when moon 
         is enabled.

      4. Mode order.  Low to high, or high to low.

      5. Mode group.  First 3 groups are regular groups without any
         Turbo modes with 1, 3 and 5 levels.  Next 3 groups are the 
         same as the first 3 but with additional Turbo modes.  Last 3
         groups are special modes.  After clicking, the light should 
         come on in a special group-select mode.  In this mode, it 
         slowly blinks 9 times, pauses, then repeats.  Turn the light 
         off after N blinks to select mode group N.
         The mode groups are: (output is approximate)

         1. 700 (High)
         2. 8, 140, 700 (Low-Medium-High)
         3. 8, 50, 140, 350, 700 (L-ML-M-MH-H)
         4. 700, 2500 (High-Turbo)
         5. 8, 140, 700, 2500 (L-M-H-T)
         6. 8, 50, 140, 350, 700, 1100, 1700, 2500 (L-ML-M-MH-H-T1-T2-T3)
         7. 140, 2400, strobe
            (police modes)
         8. bike flasher, battcheck, 25, 140, 2400
            (biking modes)
         9. 2, 8, 25, 50, 90, 140
            (7135-only mode)

         Example: To select group 3 (low-med-high), let it blink three 
         times then click the button.

         Note: 140 lm means 100% on the 7135 channel, while 2400 means 
         100% on the FET channel.  Both are no-PWM modes.  Note that 
         groups 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all feature the 140 lm level for
         maximum efficiency.

      6. Medium-press.  Off or on.  If on, a medium-press will allow 
         going backward through the mode sequence, and hidden blinky 
         modes will be accessible.

      7. Thermal calibration.  Set the temperature at which the light 
         will begin stepping down to cool itself off.  After clicking to 
         select this, the light should turn on in a special thermal 
         calibration mode.  It will start at a medium-low brightness, 
         wait a second or two, then step up to turbo.

         - To turn off thermal regulation, click within the first second 
           (while the output is relatively low).

         - To set a new maximum temperature, leave the light on until 
           you think it is too hot, then turn it off.  From this point 
           on, the light will use that new temperature as its maximum 
           allowed heat.

           Note that there may be a delay between when you feel the heat 
           and when the MCU feels the heat, so the value saved may be a 
           little bit lower than expected.

      8. Factory reset.  Change all settings back to default.
